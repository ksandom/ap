# A word about units

The aviation industry is in a transition period between imperial and metric.

Where possible, I'm biasing towards metric. But often it still makes sense to use imperial, because that's what people are used to. Therefore we often need to do some conversions.

As a general guide. Where possible I

* Use metric for calculations.
* Display it in what ever makes the most sense for the given scenario.
* Take it in in what ever form it comes.

Longer term, I intend to move entirely to metric.
